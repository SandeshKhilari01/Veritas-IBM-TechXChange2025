##  Problem Statement

With increasing global (GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001) and regional (India‚Äôs PDPB, CERT-In) regulations, most software teams still handle compliance reactively:

-  Hastily generated documents
-  Missed deadlines and incomplete evidence
-  Legal, financial, and reputational risk
-  Product launch delays and overburdened teams

This issue is **amplified in AI, fintech, and public sectors**, where compliance is expected **by design**.

---

## Solution ‚Äì What Veritas Does

Veritas integrates **compliance intelligence** throughout the **software delivery lifecycle (SDLC)**.  
It continuously analyzes project artifacts (code, configs, docs) and uses **AI + RAG** to:

‚úÖ Highlight violations  
‚úÖ Confirm tested regulatory controls  
‚úÖ Translate legal clauses into actionable technical items  
‚úÖ Generate structured remediation tasks for traceability  

> Veritas empowers security teams, developers, and compliance leaders to stay audit-ready ‚Äî all the time.
